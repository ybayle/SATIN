# SATIN

SATIN stands for `Set of Audio Tags and Identifiers Normalized` and was proposed in [this article](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Toward-better-playlists-from-bigger-musical-databases-use-case-in-singing-voice-detection-at-track-scale).
SATIN is a Music Information Retrieval (MIR) database for reproducible research.
SATIN is shipped along SOFT1, the first Set Of FeaTures extracted by musical pieces referenced by SATIN.

## Aim of SATIN

- Guarantee long-term reproducible research in MIR
- Enable precise identification and reuse of musical pieces
- Foster research in multiple MIR tasks such as Cover Song Identification and Singer Gender Classification.
